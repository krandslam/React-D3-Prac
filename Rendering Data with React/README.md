A program that loads in some [data about CSS named colors](https://gist.github.com/curran/b236990081a24761f7000567094914e0) using D3 utilities, and uses React to render the data as a radial burst!

Result: ![color visualization](https://github.com/krandslam/React-D3-Prac/assets/58777020/77945991-0f77-401a-bd23-ac60c6073457)
